Installing

Open a terminal in your bot's folder and type the following command:
npm install 

Setup

Open the config.yml file and make the following changes:
- Change the bot token to your bot's token.
- Change the application ID to your bot's application ID.  
- Set the bot's status to your preference.
- Set the welcome channel ID.
- Customize the embedded messages to your liking.

Starting

In the same terminal as above or in a new one, use the command:
node index.js

No watermark

Send me a DM on liamdavids16. to remove the watermark. The cost is €5, or €10 for the open-source version.

Attention

Do not change any file or folder names, as this may cause the bot to malfunction.
